# hello-raylib
A repository for an iterative, explorative game using Raylib.

Why Raylib? I've been playing around with Godot and dipping my toes in other,
modern game engines. The problem is that they all provide so much more than I
need, and their structure adds complexity to my process. Raylib provides the
system abstraction and hardware acceleration that I want without trying to tell
me how to structure or create my game (and without the assumption of what kinds
of games I want to make with it.

We'll see how it goes.
